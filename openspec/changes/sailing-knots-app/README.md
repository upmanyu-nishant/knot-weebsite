# Sailing Knots — Nautical-themed React App

This change adds a small React app scaffold (Vite) with a nautical theme and a knot gallery. It uses inline SVGs for illustrations and a responsive grid.

Quick start:

```bash
cd "openspec/changes/sailing-knots-app"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Files added:
- package.json — install and run scripts
- index.html, vite.config.js
- src/ (App, components, data, styles)

Want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server now? Reply and I will run it here.
